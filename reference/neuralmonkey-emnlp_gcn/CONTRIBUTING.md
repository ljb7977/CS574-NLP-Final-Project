# Guidelines for Contributing

Neural Monkey follows the standard pull-request procedure, so fork, clone,
edit, commit, push and send us your pull request.  See Github [5-min overview
of the workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) and [a quick
tutorial on forking and requesting
pulls](https://gist.github.com/Chaser324/ce0505fbed06b947d962).

Please read and follow [Neural Monkey Developer
Guidelines](http://neural-monkey.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development.html).

Any code monkey willing to work for peanuts is more than welcome to see our
[issues labelled
'help-wanted'](https://github.com/ufal/neuralmonkey/labels/help%20wanted).
These issues are particularly suited for newcomers: our comments should
describe what is needed where. If you start working on any of these issues,
please add a comment so that others know about you.  You can also use the
comments to discuss the division of work with other contributors.
