# Test scripts

- `lint_run.sh` runs pylint
- `mypy_run.sh` runs mypy
- `unit-tests_run.sh` runs unit tests
- `tests_run.sh` runs training with small dataset and `small.ini` configuration

All the scripts should be run from the main directory of the repository. There
is also `run_tests.sh` in the main directory, that runs all the tests above.
